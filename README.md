# MVAA

MVAA is a tool to create multivariate asymmetry brain maps. 

## pre-requisites

* **You need two images**: the unflipped (u) and the flipped (f). These images must be in NIFTI format. Ideally you want these images to be registered to a symmetric brain template so you can obtain a near-voxel correspondance. However, if the images are not registered, the script will still run as long as they have the same spatial dimensions.

* **Python dependencies**: 
    
    numpy    : http://www.numpy.org/ 
    
    PyNifti  : http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/pynifti/
   
    PyCuda   : http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/


* **CPU is optional**: the code is designed to run using CUDA (through PyCuda). However if you don't have a GPU, you can still run the CPU version (way slower.. go for a coffee...). However, I recommend you to install CUDA in your machine, then PyCuda.

## Usage

- GPU version
```python
mvaa_ks.py     -u <unflipped.nii.gz>  -f <flipped.nii.gz>  -r <radius>  #GPU version     
mvaa_ks_cpu.py -u <unflipped.nii.gz>  -f <flipped.nii.gz>  -r <radius>  #CPU version
```
The radius parameter will depend on how robust your GPU is and how large you want the voxel neighbourhoods to be. I have used a value of r=3 for brain images with a voxel size of 1mm. This adds up to having neighbourhoods of 7mm in diameter/ 3.5mm in radius (center voxel + r):

<pre>
           1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1    = 7
         .___.___.___.___.___.___.___.
         | 3 | 2 | 1 |   |   |   |   |
         .___.___.___.___.___.___.___.
         <------------ c  ----------->
                r = 3
                d = 7
</pre>
But, the size in milimmetres will depend on your voxel resolution. Nonetheless, r>4 may hog your GPU. So make sure you have a good one (plus, why would you want larger neighbourhoods?), OR you can use the CPU version.
